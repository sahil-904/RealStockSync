# RealStockSync üöÄüìà  
**Real-time Stock Prediction using Ensemble Learning and Sentiment Analysis**

RealStockSync is a real-time, end-to-end stock price prediction pipeline that combines financial market data and Twitter sentiment using ensemble learning models (LightGBM + LSTM). The system performs streaming data ingestion, feature engineering, model inference, and dashboard visualization to forecast stock movements.

## üìä Model Performance (Ensemble)

| Stock | R¬≤ Score | RMSE  | MAE   |
|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| AAPL  | 0.8074   | 0.0345 | 0.0296 |
| GOOGL | 0.9275   | 0.0251 | 0.0188 |
| MSFT  | 0.9794   | 0.0224 | 0.0178 |
| AMZN  | 0.9788   | 0.0261 | 0.0200 |
| TSLA  | 0.9528   | 0.0212 | 0.0166 |

## üìà Sample Visualization

![Ensemble Prediction vs Actual Value for Each Stock](output_data/ensemble_model_prediction.png)
![Tableau Dashboard](output_data/tableau_ss.png)

The above visualization compares the ensemble model‚Äôs predictions with actual closing prices for multiple stocks. This plot demonstrates how closely the model tracks real stock market behavior, offering a quick visual assessment of prediction accuracy across time.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Model Improvements

- Integrate more advanced deep learning architectures like **Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT)** or **Informer** for improved sequence modeling.
- Incorporate **cross-stock learning** by introducing relational features across correlated stocks.
- Improve the ensemble strategy by introducing **meta-learners** to dynamically weight predictions from base models.

### Drift Detection, Scheduling, API Deployment, etc.

- Implement **concept drift detection** using statistical monitoring to identify shifts in data distribution and trigger model retraining.
- Add a **task scheduler (like Airflow or Prefect)** to automate end-to-end data ingestion, processing, and model inference pipelines.
- Deploy models using **FastAPI** or **Flask** for serving predictions via REST APIs.
- Include **logging and monitoring tools** (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for production-grade observability.
- Expand visualization to include interactive forecasting dashboards with **real-time updates** and historical backtesting.
